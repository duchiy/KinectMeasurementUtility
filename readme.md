Description
This program measures object using the Kinect.  It measures the objects by creating points
on the edges of the object.  The program provide a simple edge detection algorithm using the 
Open CV via emgu.

Limitation:
The accuracy is better for larger objects 75 inches.  Also the distance between the Kinect
and the object affects the accuracy.  The kinect needs to be about 1 meter from the object.
